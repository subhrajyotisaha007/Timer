# Timer
it's timer mainly which helps to track the work efficiency and have a break also after the work time so we can track both Worke time and Breaktime. After some reps it will show us to take a long break also. After completeing every worktime it will show one checkmark. That was simple project though I have to think some more to showing the exact clock design - [00:00].
There 2 button mainly
1. start - it will start the timer.
2. reset - it will stop the current timer and reset it to 00:00
